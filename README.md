# üìä Applying Statistical Modeling to Analyze and Predict Storage Capacity Utilization

## üìù Abstract
This research introduces a statistical modeling approach to analyze and predict storage capacity utilization in a cutting-edge artifact management platform widely used in DevOps pipelines and agile software development workflows. The platform manages digital assets such as build outputs, dependencies, and container images, where storage capacity is a critical factor. Administrators face challenges in maintaining optimal storage utilization and avoiding unplanned downtimes due to capacity exhaustion.

The proposed solution employs machine learning techniques, specifically univariate linear regression analysis, to predict storage consumption trends. By leveraging historical data from repository logs, the model forecasts future storage requirements, enabling proactive capacity planning and reducing risks associated with storage depletion. The model provides practical solutions for administrators to maintain continuous system operations, improve resource management, and ensure alignment with business objectives.
